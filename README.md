## rpiLocaleFix.sh

How to fix perl warning "setting locale failed" in Raspbian.

The warnings this script fixed for me:
```
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LC_**="en_GB.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.

perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_**** to default locale: No such file or directory
```
#### **edit**: This problem occured while using SSH from another computer

This is a fault on the SSH client.

To fix this, edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config on the SSH client (your computer) and remove the line<br>
```
SendEnv LANG LC_*
```

## Disable Website
We all hate a site or two. We hate finding it in our Google search results, we hate visiting it by mistake, we hate to be reminded that it exists. Thanks to Chrome extensions it is very easy to block that site completely.<br>
- **Step 1: Block the site in Google Search Results**
  - Install the [uBlacklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe "uBlacklist") extension.
  - Right-click the extension icon and go to **Options**. Add the URL pattern you want to block, for example:
  ```
  *://*.pinterest.com/*
  *://*pinterest.com/*
  ```
- **Step 2: Block the site in your Browser**
  - Install the [Block Site](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh "Block Site - Website Blocker for Chromeâ„¢") extension.
  - Right-click the extension icon and go to **Options**. Click **Block by word** and add the wordpattern you want to block, for example:
  ```
  pinterest.c
  ```
  
    ####      That's it!
