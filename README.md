How to fix perl warning "setting locale failed" in Raspbian.

The warnings this script fixed for me:
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LC_**="en_GB.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.

perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_**** to default locale: No such file or directory
